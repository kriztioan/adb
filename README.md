# Article Database

`Article Database` (`AdB`) is a searchable web-based citation and article (PDF) database application. `AdB` is written in C++ and relies on the [Common Gateway Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) (`CGI`) for communication with its webserver. There is tight integration with the [NASA Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) (`ADS`) using their web API ([free token needed](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/account/login)). This allows easy importing of citations and papers (PDF) into `AdB`. In addition, citations can be imported using [DOIs](https://www.doi.org/), which relies on the services provided by [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org). Existing  [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) bibliographies can be directly imported into `AdB` as well.

Citations can be exported as [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/), [MSWord](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/word/concepts/working-with-word/working-with-bibliographies), and text. [PDFjs](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is included to view article PDFs directly from within `AdB`.

Optionally, `AdB` translates [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) journal abbreviations from a bibliography database file that provides mnemonics, e.g., those used by the [ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/aas_macros.html).

There are a number of tools for organizing and maintaining `AdB`. These include a duplicates record finder, re-indexing, and a DOI finder for records missing one (via [crossref](api.crossref.org)). Furthermore, one can list all keywords and authors in present in `AdB`.

The look of `AdB` is theme-able, with a number of themes included by default.

## Usage

Building `AdB` requires the following to be available and/or installed:

1. `cmake`
2. `GNU` C++ compiler
3. `jemalloc`
4. `openssl`
5. `rapidjson`
6. `pkg-config`

The web application is build with:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

This produces a directory called `adb` that should be moved into your webserver root directory. Using a web browser you can then navigate to:

```shell
http://localhost/adb/index.cgi
```

and start using the application.

## Theming

`AdB` uses Cascading Stylesheet (`css`) theming. A number of themes are provided in the [plugins](web/plugins)-directory, which is a good place to  start your own theming.

## Notes

1. The `GNU` C++ compiler is hardcoded to `g++-12` in `CMakeLists.txt`, change if needed.
2. The `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` is hardcoded to `/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@3/3.0.7` in `CMakeLists.txt`, change if needed.
3. The PEM certificate file used by `AdB` defaults to `/private/etc/ssl/cert.pem`, change if needed under `Config→DOI CrossRef→PEM`.
